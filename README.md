# School_Management_System
This software is a desktop application compatible with various Windows platforms such as XP, 
2007, 2008, and 2010. Its primary purpose is to streamline administrative tasks within schools, 
particularly in managing student and teacher records stored in databases.
The project aims to address the challenges associated with maintaining student and teacher 
information using traditional file systems. With this application, school administrators can 
efficiently handle a wide range of activities, making the process more manageable compared to 
manual record-keeping.
Designed to cater to schools like "GYAN NIKETAN PUBLIC SCHOOL" in New Delhi, which 
accommodates over 10,000 students, around 50 teachers, and numerous administrative staff's, 
the software significantly simplifies the critical task of record management.
Utilizing Java Swing for the front end and MySQL for the back end, the system ensures both 
security and ease of use. Java Swing is known for its robustness and simplicity, while MySQL 
provides a powerful platform for managing databases.
The "School Management System" facilitates various tasks such as student admissions, teacher 
recruitment, attendance tracking for both students and teachers, fee management, updating 
student and teacher information, recording student marks, and checking student results.
